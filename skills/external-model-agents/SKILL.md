description: Run Claude Code, Codex, or Grok as peer non-interactive agents for delegated analysis, implementation, or review. Use when one AI CLI should invoke either of the other peer CLIs without opening an interactive TUI.

# External Model Agents

Claude Code, Codex, and Grok are peers. Any one can call either of the others as an ordinary background process. They do not inherit the caller's conversation or agent context.

## Never start an interactive session

Use only these non-interactive forms:

```bash
claude -p "your prompt"
codex exec "your prompt"
grok -p "your prompt"
```

Plain `claude`, plain `codex`, and Grok without `-p/--single` open interactive interfaces. Never use those forms for delegated work: an interactive process does not exit on its own and can strand the background job forever.

## Run safely

- Run every peer CLI in the background with an explicit timeout, then read its output file. Prefer the caller's background-process option when it has one; otherwise use shell backgrounding.
- Choose the timeout deliberately. A real 30-minute run of this kind was killed with a zero-byte output file and no work to recover; long implementation or review work may need a much more generous limit.
- Ask the peer to write its deliverable incrementally to a named file and print only a short final summary. A kill then preserves partial work, and the caller avoids reading an expensive long stdout transcript. Give the peer write permission to the deliverable location.
- Brief the peer like a fresh agent: give the repository path, task, known facts, exclusions, constraints, expected deliverable path, and ownership of other agents' work.
- Explicitly tell it to read applicable `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md` files. It has not read them merely because the caller has.

## CLI reference

### Claude Code

```bash
timeout 60m claude \
  -p \
  --model sonnet \
  --effort medium \
  --permission-mode auto \
  --output-format text \
  "your prompt" \
  > /tmp/claude-agent.out 2>&1 &
```

`-p/--print` prints a response and exits. `--output-format` accepts `text`, `json`, or `stream-json`; `--json-schema` constrains structured output. Use `--permission-mode` plus `--allowed-tools`, `--disallowed-tools`, or `--tools` to bound tool access. Available permission modes are `acceptEdits`, `auto`, `bypassPermissions`, `manual`, `dontAsk`, and `plan`. `--no-session-persistence` prevents saving a print-mode session. Reserve `--dangerously-skip-permissions` for an externally isolated sandbox where bypassing checks is deliberate.

### Codex

```bash
timeout 60m codex exec \
  -c model=gpt-5.6-sol \
  -c model_reasoning_effort=medium \
  --sandbox read-only \
  -o /tmp/codex-agent.out \
  "your prompt" \
  > /tmp/codex-agent.log 2>&1 &
```

`exec` is the non-interactive subcommand. Set model and reasoning effort together with `-c key=value` overrides; `-m/--model` is also available for the model, but reasoning effort has no dedicated flag. Use `--sandbox read-only` for analysis that needs no model-written artifact and `--sandbox workspace-write` when the task must edit or save incremental output. `-o FILE` writes the final message to a file; `--json` emits JSONL events; `--skip-git-repo-check` permits work outside a Git repository.

### Grok

```bash
timeout 60m grok \
  -m grok-4.6 \
  --effort medium \
  --permission-mode auto \
  -p "your prompt" \
  > /tmp/grok-agent.out 2>&1 &
```

`-p/--single` supplies a single-turn prompt, prints the response, and exits. Choose the model with `-m/--model`, reasoning depth with `--reasoning-effort` or `--effort`, and non-interactive tool handling with `--permission-mode auto`. `--output-format` accepts `plain`, `json`, `streaming-json`, or `streaming-messages-json`; `--json-schema` constrains the response and implies JSON output.

## Preserve repository contracts

Peer output remains subject to the caller's repository rules and task scope.

- Public URLs must not change.
- Do not re-pin content-authority digests merely to make a failing test pass. A deliberate re-pin is legitimate only when the underlying authority intentionally changed and the reason is stated.
- Keep PII out of Git, logs, prompts, and reports.
- In a shared worktree, stage and commit explicit paths only. Never use `git add -A` or `git commit -a` while other agents may share the index.

## Peer composition examples

Each example is non-interactive, bounded by a timeout, runs in the background, and captures stdout. Replace paths, models, and prompts for the task.

### Claude calling Codex or Grok

```bash
timeout 60m codex exec -c model=gpt-5.6-sol -c model_reasoning_effort=medium \
  -C /repo --sandbox workspace-write -o /repo/.tmp/codex-final.md \
  "Read CLAUDE.md and AGENTS.md. Review X; Y is known, Z is out of scope, and another agent owns W. Write findings incrementally to /repo/.tmp/codex-review.md; print only a short summary." \
  > /tmp/codex-run.log 2>&1 &

timeout 60m grok --cwd /repo -m grok-4.6 --effort medium --permission-mode auto \
  -p "Read CLAUDE.md and AGENTS.md. Review X; Y is known, Z is out of scope, and another agent owns W. Write findings incrementally to /repo/.tmp/grok-review.md; print only a short summary." \
  > /tmp/grok-result.txt 2>&1 &
```

### Codex calling Claude or Grok

```bash
timeout 60m claude -p --add-dir /repo --model sonnet --effort medium --permission-mode auto \
  --output-format text \
  "Work in /repo. Read CLAUDE.md and AGENTS.md. Implement X; Y is known, Z is out of scope, and another agent owns W. Write progress incrementally to /repo/.tmp/claude-work.md; print only a short summary." \
  > /tmp/claude-result.txt 2>&1 &

timeout 60m grok --cwd /repo -m grok-4.6 --effort medium --permission-mode auto \
  -p "Read CLAUDE.md and AGENTS.md. Implement X; Y is known, Z is out of scope, and another agent owns W. Write progress incrementally to /repo/.tmp/grok-work.md; print only a short summary." \
  > /tmp/grok-result.txt 2>&1 &
```

### Grok calling Claude or Codex

```bash
timeout 60m claude -p --add-dir /repo --model sonnet --effort medium --permission-mode auto \
  --output-format text \
  "Work in /repo. Read CLAUDE.md and AGENTS.md. Analyze X; Y is known, Z is out of scope, and another agent owns W. Write findings incrementally to /repo/.tmp/claude-analysis.md; print only a short summary." \
  > /tmp/claude-result.txt 2>&1 &

timeout 60m codex exec -c model=gpt-5.6-sol -c model_reasoning_effort=medium \
  -C /repo --sandbox workspace-write -o /repo/.tmp/codex-final.md \
  "Read CLAUDE.md and AGENTS.md. Analyze X; Y is known, Z is out of scope, and another agent owns W. Write findings incrementally to /repo/.tmp/codex-analysis.md; print only a short summary." \
  > /tmp/codex-run.log 2>&1 &
```

After launch, use the caller's background-job mechanism to monitor completion. On completion or timeout, read the requested deliverable first, then the short captured summary or diagnostic log.
